The game was made with Libgdx framework, which is a java graphics/game framework.


The game uses some graphics from other games,
but our use is educational.

This game was for the computer networks course 
EE 305 and it was done in approximetly 1 month.

The game is not fully completed as we had only
1 month to finish the game.

Feel free to use this project.
